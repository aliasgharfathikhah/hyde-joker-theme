### Description

This theme plunges your desktop into the chaotic and fractured mind of the Clown Prince of Crime. Inspired by the gritty, anarchic aesthetic of the Joker from the iconic 2008 film and the dark, melancholic atmosphere of the 2019 masterpiece, this theme is for those who find beauty in chaos.

The color palette is a carefully crafted descent into madness: deep, unsettling purples and vibrant, toxic greens clash with blood-red highlights, all set against a dark, Gotham-inspired background. Itâ€™s designed to be immersive, stylish, and just a little bit insane.

### Features

-   **Hyprland:** Custom borders with red/black gradients, increased blur, and shadows.
-   **Kitty Terminal:** A dark theme with Joker's signature colors.
-   **Rofi Launcher:** A sleek, centered launcher that asks the only question that matters: "Why so serious?"
-   **Waybar:** A stylish bar with a subtle gradient and sharp, readable modules.
-   **Kvantum:** Ensures your Qt applications (like Dolphin) don't escape the madness.
-   **Custom Font:** Includes the "Gothic Joker" font for the complete experience.
-   **Wallpapers:** A curated collection of high-quality Joker wallpapers.
